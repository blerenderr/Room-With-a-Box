## Overview
An Episodic Half-Life 2 mod revolving around a box and a room. 
My first mod, but the map isn't complete shit because I have a good amount of experience with Hammer.
## Install Instructions
1. Make sure you have "Source SDK Base 2013 Singleplayer" installed, [steam://rungameid/243730]
2. Go to your local "steamapps" folder in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam
3. Navigate to the "sourcemods" folder, if it's not already there, just create it
4. Extract the contents of this repo to "sourcemods", and rename "Room-With-a-Box-master" to "mod_episodic". This is a really lazy fix for the game not being able to find some files in the structure due to me basing this off of hl2e2.
5. Done! Restart Steam by going to Steam>Exit in the top left corner. The game should show up in your library.
